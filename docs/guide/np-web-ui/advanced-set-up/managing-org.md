# Managing Your Organization
The **Organization** option enables Nexploit administrators to manage organization-level settings and policies, including the following:
* [Displaying the Organization Dashboard](#Displaying-the-Organization-Dashboard)
* [Configuring Two-factor Authentication Policy](#Configuring-Two-factor-Authentication-Policy)
* [Defining the Hosts Authorized for Scanning](#Defining-the-Hosts-Authorized-for-Scanning)
* [Viewing Your Organization’s Plan](#Viewing-your-Organizations-Plan)
* [Managing Users](#Managing-Users-Members)

## Displaying the Organization Dashboard
To view your organization dashboard, in the left pane, select the **Organization** option. 

![Dashboard](media/dashboard.png ':size=60%')

## Configuring Two-Factor Authentication Policy
You can require that all users in your organization use two-factor authentication (2FA). Before applying this policy, we recommend giving your users prior notice so that they have time to enable 2FA for their accounts. 

To apply 2FA to user accounts, select the relevant checkbox in the **ORGANIZATION SETTINGS** section.

![2FA](media/2fa.png ':size=60%')

An administrator can see the 2FA status of each user in the organization in the **MEMBERS** section.
>[!NOTE|label:Note]
An organization-wide 2FA policy cannot be set to mandatory until all the administrative users have set up their own 2FA. <p>
When enabling an organization-wide 2FA policy, the users can access their accounts only after they perform 2FA. In this case, an email notification is automatically sent to each affected user.

## Defining the Hosts Authorized for Scanning
As a precaution, Nexploit only allows hosts that are in the authorized list defined below to be scanned. 

To add a target host to the authorized list of hosts, follow these steps:
1. Add a `.nex` file to your application root directory. To obtain this file, click the `.nex` link at the bottom of the **ORGANIZATION SETTINGS** section.

![Get-Nex-File](media/get-nex-file.png ':size=60%')

2. Save this file in a convenient place and then put it in your application root directory. 

>[!NOTE|label:Note]
Make sure that the server can serve this file from the webroot (top directory level or just `/` path) along with the other static resources from that location. 

You can reuse this file as many times as needed.

## Viewing Your Organization Plan
The organization **PLAN DETAILS** section displays information about your Nexploit account, for example total storage for your organization, number of engines and the plan expiration date.
