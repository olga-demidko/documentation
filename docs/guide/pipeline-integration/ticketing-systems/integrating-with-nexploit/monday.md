      You can connect your Monday board (workspace) to a Nexploit scan to get all the discovered issues on automatically created Monday tickets. Nexploit opens each new ticket for one specific issue and provides the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>Issue severity level</li>
        <li>Details of discovery</li>
        <li>Possible exposure</li>
        <li>Remediation suggestions </li>
      </ul>
      For each new scan, you can select any of your Monday boards integrated with your NexPloit projects.

#### Configure Nexploit Integration with Monday Boards 
After you have connected Nexploit to your Monday account, you need to integrate one or multiple Monday boards with the Nexploit project to be used for the scan. The integration allows Nexploit to automatically provide the scan reports on the associated Monday boards. Moreover, you can select a certain severity level of issues (findings) to be sent to the boards associated with your Nexploit project.  

To integrate a specific Nexploit project with your Monday board(s), follow [these steps](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/adding-to-project/integrating-with-project.md).
