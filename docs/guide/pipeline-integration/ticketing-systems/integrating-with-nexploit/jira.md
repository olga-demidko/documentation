      You can connect your Jira project board to a Nexploit scan to get all the discovered issues on automatically created Jira tickets. Nexploit opens each new ticket for one specific issue and provides the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>Issue severity level</li>
        <li>Details of discovery</li>
        <li>Possible exposure</li>
        <li>Remediation suggestions </li>
      </ul>
      For each new scan, you can select any of your Jira projects integrated with your Nexploit projects.

If your Jira project sets any required fields for all task tickets (for example, components), then Nexploit will not be able to open tickets for detected issues, since it cannot complete the required fields. Please check your project settings and change them if necessary.

### Prerequisites

* You are an active user on [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app/). 

### Step-by-Step Guide
#### Connect Nexploit to Your Jira Account

1. Go to [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app).
2. In the left pane, select **Organization**. 
3. On the **Organization** page, scroll down to the **TICKET MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION** section.

  ![ticketing-management-integration](media/azure/ticketing-management-integration.png ':size=60%')

  
4. Click ![dots-button](media/azure/icon-button.png ':size=2%') next to **Jira**, and then select **Settings**.

  ![jira-settings](media/jira/jira-settings.png ':size=45%')

5. On the **JIRA INTEGRATION CONFIG popup**, do one of the following:

  ![jira-on-premise](media/jira/on-premise.png ':size=35%')

  * If you are using the Atlassian Jira Cloud, select the **Cloud Jira** radio button. Then enter your Jira details and API token in the relative fields, and click **Save**.
  
  > [!WARNING|label:Important] For security purposes, make sure to use the API token of a specific Jira profile (not the Admin/Organization level).

  The Nexploit connection to the Jira is enabled that is indicated in the **Enabled** column. At that, the **Connectivity** column indicates a local Jira Server connection status.  

  ![jira-enabled](media/jira/enabled-disconnected.png ':size=45%')

  * If you are using a local Jira Server, select the **On-Premise Jira** radio button. In the **Access Key** field, copy an automatically generated `INTEGRATION_ACCESS_KEY` and switch to the [Nexploit CLI](/guide/np-cli/overview) to proceed with the Nexploit connection to your <br> On-Premise Jira.

  To find the information on how to connect Nexploit to the On-Premise Jira via the Nexploit CLI, see [Integrating with a Service](/guide/np-cli/commands/integrating-with-a-service). 

  After you perform the connection via the Nexploit CLI, the **TICKET MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION** section of the [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app) indicates the **Connected** status of the On-Premise Jira. At that, the **Enabled** column indicates a general Jira connection status.

#### Configure Jira Integration with Nexploit Projects
After you have connected Nexploit to your Cloud or On-Premise Jira, you need to integrate one or multiple Jira projects with the Nexploit project to be used for a scan. The integration allows Nexploit to automatically provide the scan reports on the associated Jira boards. Moreover, you can select a certain severity level of issues (findings) to be sent to the boards associated with your Nexploit project.

To integrate a specific Nexploit project with your Jira project(s), follow [these steps](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/adding-to-project/integrating-with-project.md).
