# Ticketing Systems Integration
You can view and manage the Nexploit reports on every detected vulnerability in the ticketing and communication systems that you use in your development environment. The integration allows you to simplify and fasten the process of solving the security issues of your application or API by using the automatically created issue tickets and distributing the remediation tasks among your development team.  

## Integration Navigation <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
To enable Nexploit to send the scan reports to multiple repositories (projects, channels) of your ticketing and communication systems, you need to do the following:
1. Connect Nexploit to the relative systems and select the repositories to which Nexploit should have access: 
    * [Jira](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/integrating-with-nexploit/jira.md)
    * [GitHub](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/integrating-with-nexploit/github.md)
    * [Slack](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/integrating-with-nexploit/slack.md)
    * [Azure Boards](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/integrating-with-nexploit/azure.md)
    * [Monday](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/integrating-with-nexploit/monday.md)

2. Associate the connected repository(es) with a specific Nexploit project, and then add the associated repositories to a new scan within the specified project. To do that, go to the [Adding to Nexploit Project](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/adding-to-project.md) section.
