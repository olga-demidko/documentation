# Usage Examples
## Example 1. Direct scanning using the Nexploit CLI (NPM installation)
To apply this option, you only need to install the Nexploit CLI globally on your Jenkins machine using the relative NPM command. 

### Prerequisites<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
* You are an active user on  [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app). 
*  You have a valid [organization API key](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-org?id=managing-organization-apicli-authentication-tokens) or [personal API key](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-personal-account?id=managing-your-personal-api-keys-authentication-tokens) (`NEXPLOIT_TOKEN`) with the following scopes: `bot`,<br>`scans : run`,`scan : read`, and `scans : stop`.
* You have downloaded the Node.js plug-in to your Jenkins machine.
* You have created the `NEXPLOIT_TOKEN` environmental variable on your Jenkins machine.


### Step-by-Step Guide<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<!-- tabs:start -->

##### **STEP 1 - Install the CLI**

```bash
sh 'npm install @neuralegion/nexploit-cli -g || true'
```

##### **STEP 2 -  Run (Re-Test) a Scan**
* If you need to run a new scan with a Crawler,  use the following script: 

```bash
echo "Start Nexploit Scan üèÅ"
SCAN_ID=$(nexploit-cli scan:run --token $NEXPLOIT_TOKEN --name "Test Jenkins Scan" --crawler www.example.com --smart)
echo "Scan was started with ID https://nexploit.app/scans/$SCAN_ID\n"
```
* If you need to re-test a previous scan with its ID `OLD_SCAN_ID`, use the following script:

```bash
echo "Retest a scan"
NEW_SCAN_ID=$(nexploit-cli scan:retest --token=$NEXPLOIT_TOKEN $OLD_SCAN_ID)
echo "Scan was started with ID https://nexploit.app/scans/$NEW_SCAN_ID\n"
```

##### **STEP 3 -  Poll the Results**

>[!NOTE|label:Note]
When polling the scan results, it is recommended to follow the fail-fast principle by using the `breakpoint` command.  See [Nexploit CLI Command List](guide/np-cli/command-list.md) for a full list of commands you can use in your Jenkins flow.

Poll the scan until until it returns some issue, or its time runs out:

```bash
echo "Wait for issues ‚è≥\n"
RESULT=$(nexploit-cli scan:polling --interval 30s --timeout 20m --token $NEXPLOIT_TOKEN --breakpoint medium_issue $SCAN_ID)
if [ -z "$RESULT" ]
then
  echo "Failed to stop scan"
else
  echo "Stop Scan üõë"
  nexploit-cli scan:stop --token $NEXPLOIT_TOKEN $SCAN_ID
```

##### **STEP 4 -  View the  Results**
To view the reports on the detected issues, go to the [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app).

### Complete Example<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The following example is made up of the steps above and shows how to run a new scan using the Crawler discovery type:
```bash
pipeline {
 agent any
 environment {
   NEXPLOIT_TOKEN = $NEXPLOIT_TOKEN
   }
 tools {nodejs "node"}
 stages {
   stage("Install Dep"){
       steps{
           sh 'npm install @neuralegion/nexploit-cli -g || true'
       }
   }
   stage('Start Scan') {
     steps {
         sh '''#!/bin/bash
           echo "Start Nexploit Scan üèÅ"
           SCAN_ID=$(nexploit-cli scan:run --token ${NEXPLOIT_TOKEN} --name "Test Jenkins Scan" --crawler https://brokencrystals.com/ --smart)
           echo "Scan was started with ID https://nexploit.app/scans/$SCAN_ID\n"
           sleep 10
           echo "Wait for issues ‚è≥\n"
           RESULT=$(nexploit-cli scan:polling --interval 30s --timeout 20m --token $NEXPLOIT_TOKEN --breakpoint medium_issue $SCAN_ID)
           if [ -z "$RESULT" ]
           then
               echo "Failed to stop scan"
           else
               echo "Stop Scan üõë"
               nexploit-cli scan:stop --token $NEXPLOIT_TOKEN $SCAN_ID
           fi
       '''
     }
   }
 }
}
```

## Example 2. Scanning via a Repeater using the Nexploit CLI (NPM installation)
To apply this option, you need to install the Nexploit CLI on your Jenkins machine and activate the Repeater using the Repeater ID and Nexploit API key. 

### Prerequisites<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
* You are an active user on  [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app). 
* You have a Repeater with a valid ID ‚ÄòREPEATER‚Äô. See [Managing Repeaters](/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-repeaters.md) for the information about handling the Repeaters.
*  You have a valid [organization API key](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-org?id=managing-organization-apicli-authentication-tokens) or [personal API key](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-personal-account?id=managing-your-personal-api-keys-authentication-tokens) (`NEXPLOIT_TOKEN`) with the following scopes: `bot`,<br>`scans : run`,`scan : read`, and `scans : stop`.
* You have downloaded the Node.js plug-in to your Jenkins machine.
* You have created the `NEXPLOIT_TOKEN` environmental variable on your Jenkins machine.

##### **STEP 1 - Install the CLI**

```bash
sh 'npm install @neuralegion/nexploit-cli -g || true'
```
##### **STEP 2 - Activate the Repeater**

```bash
PID_REPEATER=$(nexploit-cli repeater --token=$NEXPLOIT_TOKEN --agent=$REPEATER &> /dev/null & echo $!)
echo "Repeater PID: $PID_REPEATER"
```

>[!NOTE|label:Note]
If a valid API token `NEXPLOIT-TOKEN` and Repeater ID `REPEATER` were not added, then the **Unauthorized access** error appears. Please check your credentials.

>[!Warning|label:Important]
Make sure that the Repeater has an outbound connection to the Nexploit host depending on its deployment. The Repeater should be connected either to the default **amq.nexploit.app** via the AMQ protocol (over TLS) using port 5672 or to your private cloud using the relative port. 

##### **STEP 3 -  Run (Re-Test) a Scan**

```bash
echo "Retest a scan"

# Retest a previous scan with its ID `OLD_SCAN_ID` and API key `NEXPLOIT_TOKEN`
NEW_SCAN_ID=$(nexploit-cli scan:retest --token=$NEXPLOIT_TOKEN $OLD_SCAN_ID;
echo "Scan started $NEW_SCAN_ID";
```

##### **STEP 4 -  Poll the Results**

>[!NOTE|label:Note]
When polling the scan results, it is recommended to follow the fail-fast principle by using the `breakpoint` command.  See [Nexploit CLI Command List](guide/np-cli/command-list.md) for a full list of commands you can use in your Jenkins flow.

```bash
echo "Poll for scan results";

# Poll the scan until it returns some issue, or its time runs out
RESULT=$(nexploit-cli scan:polling --token=$NEXPLOIT_TOKEN --failure-on=first-issue --interval=10000 $NEW_SCAN_ID);

# After that - stop the scan
nexploit-cli scan:stop --token=$NEXPLOIT_TOKEN $NEW_SCAN_ID;

# Kill repeater process
kill -9 $PID_REPEATER

# Exit step with a code from nexploit-cli
exit $RESULT;
```

## Example 3. Scanning via a Repeater using the Nexploit CLI (Docker installation)
To apply this option, you need to configure a Docker image inside your pipeline (for example,  by creating a docker-compose file). Once the Docker is configured, you can run the Nexploit CLI and activate the Repeater using the Repeater ID and Nexploit API key.   

### Prerequisites<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
* You are an active user on  [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app). 
* You have a Repeater with a valid ID ‚ÄòREPEATER‚Äô. See [Managing Repeaters](/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-repeaters.md) for the information about handling the Repeaters.
*  You have a valid [organization API key](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-org?id=managing-organization-apicli-authentication-tokens) or [personal API key](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/np-web-ui/advanced-set-up/managing-personal-account?id=managing-your-personal-api-keys-authentication-tokens) (`NEXPLOIT_TOKEN`) with the following scopes: `bot`,<br>`scans : run`,`scan : read`, and `scans : stop`.
* You have downloaded the Node.js plug-in to your Jenkins machine.
* You have created the `NEXPLOIT_TOKEN` environmental variable on your Jenkins machine.
